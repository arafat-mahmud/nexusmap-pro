## 🚀 **How to Switch Network Sources**

### **Quick Switch in main.py:**
```python
# Change this line in main.py:
network_source = "github"        # Current (GitHub)
network_source = "linkedin_sample"  # Demo LinkedIn
network_source = "linkedin_official"  # Real LinkedIn API
```

### **Current Enhanced Analysis:**
Your GitHub analysis now includes:
- 📊 **Followers** - People following you
- 👥 **Following** - People you follow
- 🤝 **Collaborators** - Repository collaborators
- 📈 **Relationship Types** - Different connection types
- 🏢 **Network Composition** - Breakdown by group type

## 🔐 **Safe LinkedIn Integration Setup**

### **For Official LinkedIn API:**

1. **Create LinkedIn Developer App:**
   - Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/
   - Create new app
   - Get Client ID and Secret

2. **Set up OAuth Flow:**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization
   - Get access token from user consent

3. **Add to .env file:**
   ```
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_secret
   LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=user_access_token
   ```

### **⚠️ Why NOT to Use Email/Password:**
- 🚫 **Account Ban Risk** - LinkedIn actively detects and bans
- 🚫 **Security Risk** - Credentials exposed in code
- 🚫 **Terms Violation** - Against LinkedIn's ToS
- 🚫 **Unreliable** - LinkedIn changes authentication frequently
