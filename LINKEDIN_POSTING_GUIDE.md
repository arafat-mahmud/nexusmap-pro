📊 THE BREAKDOWN:
🔗 127 professional connections
🌐 8 distinct clusters 
📈 Network density: 0.34 (diverse reach)
🎯 Centrality score: 0.78 (key connector)

💡 BIGGEST SURPRISE: 60% of my network is in fintech, but I'm connecting 3 different industries!

This analysis revealed hidden patterns I never noticed. My "weak ties" are actually my strongest career assets.

🛠️ Built this with Python + NetworkX + some visualization magic.
